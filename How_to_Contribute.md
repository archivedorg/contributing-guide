### How To Submit A Contribution

Once you've identified an area you can assist with, take note of the following before opening an issue or pull request:

 - Give context on the issue to help other contributers and maintainers get up to speed quickly
 - Ensure you have done proper research on the issue - most often, solutions are already addressed in a README, project 
    document, or on other closed issues & PRs
 - Only issues regarding systems or network security should be shared with maintainers **privately**
 - Although we welcome all contributions, not all suggestions, ideas or requests can be intergrated - although this will 
    vary from project to project, kindly respect community decisions and feedback to contributions.

It’s helpful to watch *(on GitHub, you can click “Watch” to be notified of all conversations)* the projects that you're interested in to familiarize with how contributions are made, received and resolved.
