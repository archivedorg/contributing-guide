# Factory24 Maintainer Best Practices

We ❤️ maintainers here at Factory24 because to realize our mission of building disruptive solutions for Africa we rely on 
contributors and maintainers working together to pool not just your time and passion but your intellectual resources as well. 

As you start work on a new Open Source project, your work as a maintainer is relatively small compared to when your project gains popularity and attracts more than code contributors. This short write-up hightlights all the best practices to implement in your project management to ensure you foster a free and fair contributor & maintainers relationship. 

## Documentation & Communication

Documenting key processes and aspects of your project will, as a maintainer, help you calrify your own thoughts, vision of the project and also help other people understand what you need or expect. As recommended in the Github [Best Practices For Maintainers](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/), some of the key documents to include in your project are: 

* **README** - In this file, outline clearly the goals and vision of the project. 
* **CONTRIBUTING** - Your contribution file should outline in clear language how contributions will be reviewed, the types
    of acceptable contributions and follow-up steps for all new contributors.

It's also important to ensure communications between you and contributors remain public through Issue tracking, PR or other open
communication channels like Slack, Discord or IRCs.
