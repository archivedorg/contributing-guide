# Factory24 Maintainer Best Practices

We ❤️ maintainers here at Factory24 because to realize our mission of building disruptive solutions for Africa we rely on 
contributors and maintainers working together to pool not just your time and passion but your intellectual resources as well. 

As you start work on a new Open Source project, your work as a maintainer is relatively small compared to when your project gains popularity and attracts more than code contributors. This short write-up hightlights all the best practices to implement in your project management to ensure you foster a free and fair contributor & maintainers relationship.
