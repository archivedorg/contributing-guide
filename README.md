Out of the multiple projects we're building, about 60% are built on public repositories on Github, released under 
OSI-approved licenses like the MIT License, the GNU General Public License and Apache License 2.0. This ensures 
that developers who have completed any of our courses can almost immediately start contributing by reviewing code, 
creating pull requests and making commits. Essentially turning contributors to maintainers and a community.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making 
participation in our projects and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

By participating in this project (online and at live chapter events) you agree to abide by our community guidelines 
including:

* Code of Conduct
* Maintainers Best Practises
* Leadership & Governance Model
